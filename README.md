A simplest tool to check if your mouse button switch is debounded

You may have experienced that your single click is recognized as a double click by the operating system.
In most cases, this is a problem of not well debounced mechanical switch.
In this case, a single click generates two single click events in less than 70 ms or so.
There are some software solutions for this issue.

I prefer ChatteringCanceler's hybrid mode.
And I verified with this checker tool that ChatteringCanceler solved this issue.
